# CSN - Collection Space Navigator: 
Interactive Visualization Interface for Multidimensional Datasets

[Project Page: https://github.com/Collection-Space-Navigator/CSN](https://github.com/Collection-Space-Navigator/CSN)  

![CSN: Collection Space Navigation](./screenshot.png) 

The Collection Space Navigator (CSN) is an explorative visualization tool for researching collections and their multidimensional representations. We designed this tool to better understand multidimensional data, its methods, and semantic qualities through spatial navigation and filtering. CSN can be used with any image collection and can be customized for specific research needs (see Jupyter Notebbok How-To guide).


## Demo

[See WikiArt demo here](https://collection-space-navigator.github.io/CSN)

## Getting Started

We recommend using the setup notebook (`CSN_setup.ipynb` [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Collection-Space-Navigator/CSN/blob/main/CSN_setup.ipynb)) to prepare datasets and build a customized version of the Collection Space Navigator. 

## Using the Collection Space Navigator

Place your prepared dataset folders in the `build/datasets` directory and modify `build/datasets/datasets_config.json`. We recommend using the setup notebook `CSN_setup.ipynb` to format your data correctly.

To use the Collection Space Navigator locally run:
```
serve -s build
```
The CSN should be now accessible at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.


## Development 

For development only.   
Important: `node 14.21.2` required!

```
npm install
```
Installs all neccessary packages. 

```
npm start
```
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

```
npm run build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
